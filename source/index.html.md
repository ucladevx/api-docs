An **event** object is a [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) which means it has the following keys:

* **geometry**: with a type of "Point" and coordinates for latitude and longitude
* **id**: a unique id for this event
* **properties**: this contains all the event information and will be explored below
* **type**: always "Feature"

### Essential Event Properties

These properties must exist and have a valid value for every event.

* **name**: string of event's name
* **stats**: JSON for events from Facebook with attendance stats from at ~6 hour accuracy. Will have 4 keys 'attending', 'noreply', 'interested', and 'maybe' each with a integer value.
* **start_time**: string start time of event in the format `2020-02-22T08:00:00-0800`


### Potential Event Properties

These properties can exist, but are not guaranteed. Make sure to check for existence in the JSON before using.

* **description**: string description
* **hoster**: string name of event host
* **place**: JSON with a location key with another JSON. This inner location JSON contains a mandatory country, city, latitude, and longitude. There are a variety of other potential venue details such as name, street, or zip. See the example event.
* **cover_picture**: url to a photo for the event
* **ticket_uri**: url to the ticketing site
* **free_food**: YES/NO if event has free food. Currently just a strong NO. But will be updated as the Mappening team rolls out the autocategorization machine learning model.
* **end_time**: string end time of event in the format `Sat, 17 Feb 2018 23:30:00 GMT-0800`
* **time_updated**: last time event information was updated
